# Cert Manager

[![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller.
It helps with issuing certificates from Letâ€™s Encrypt and others. In this step we will install [![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) Cert Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/)
and configure it for certificate acqusition and renewal with [![](images/ico/book_16.png) LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).

> **NOTE:** Before you proceed you need a domain that you own. In this tutorial we use 'jeansdev.org'

Benefits are:

- Obtaining LetsEncrypt certificates
- Provision of a wildcard certificate for a domain and all of its subdomains
- Automated certificate renewal

Cert-Manager Kubernetes provides an integrated open source solution that does this (and much more).
The common term for the method we use is **ACME/DNS01** provider where ACME stands for **'Automated Certificate Management Environment** and
**DNS01** is the method by which LetsEncrypt validates ownership of a requested validation for a wildcard domain.
[![](images/ico/book_16.png) Read more about Letsencrypt challenges and the DNS01 challenge type](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge)

## Preparation

Prerequisites are:

- A domain you own, e.g. jeansdev.org, example.com, yourdomain.org, ...

**NOTE** that we don't need **ingress** being configured as long as we only care about **ACME/DNS01** configurations
explained here. We need access to our DNS service provider to perform the acme challenge handshake to prove the domains
ownership. (See below).

Execute

```bash
cd ~/homekube/src/cert-manager
```

## Installation

Following the [![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) Cert-Manager installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) instructions:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.15.1/cert-manager.yaml
kubectl get pod -n cert-manager --watch
```

The containers are getting up and running:

```text
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cert-manager-7747db9d88-cd7xz             1/1     Running   0          3m57s
cert-manager-cainjector-87c85c6ff-s8m9g   1/1     Running   0          3m57s
cert-manager-webhook-64dc9fff44-bl64h     1/1     Running   0          3m56s
```

Its recommended to [![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) verify the installation](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/#verifying-the-installation) .

## Configuration of Helpers

While Cert-Manager cares about automated renewal and integration of the certificates on the kubernetes level
its not able to communicate with LetsEncyrypt services directly. Instead it delegates this task to its
[![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) ACMEDNS adapter](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/acme-dns/)
which in turn makes use of another helper service. [![](images/ico/github_16.png) Acme-dns](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns#acme-dns)
is a basic DNS server that acts on behalf of your providers DNS service for the sole purpose of renewing LetsEncrypt certificates.

![](images/ico/color/homekube_16.png)[ Learn more about the principles of operation](cert-manager-long.md)

### ACME-DNS

The author of Acme-dns recommends you install your own helper service (official terminology
[![](images/ico/book_16.png) CertBot client](https://certbot.eff.org/))
which can be done following the [![](images/ico/github_16.png) usage instructions](https://github.com/joohoi/acme-dns#usage).

While its generally advisable to be in control of this component we will take the short-path here and use a public service
located at `https://auth.acme-dns.io`

> NOTE: You need to be aware that this component is cruicial for automated updates and we have to trust the provider for confidentiality.
> In case the provider terminates its services or he loses your registration data then the automated renewal gets terminated and needs to be reconfigured

Service usage is a 2 step process.
First we will register at the service manually and its response data is then used for automated updating.

#### Registration

Next we will register at the service manually:

```bash
# jq . is just for readability and can be omitted
curl -s -X POST ${HOMEKUBE_CERT_URL} | jq .

# if jq is not installed you might install it with suddo apt install jq
```

A random response will be generated. Example:

```json
{
  "allowfrom": [],
  "fulldomain": "84bba6b0-b446-42ff-8d22-11b27f4ff717.auth.acme-dns.io",
  "password": "mPSNztp-s_m2atJtT8wapPQ7Z4AIIyE4i5H7fQas",
  "subdomain": "84bba6b0-b446-42ff-8d22-11b27f4ff717",
  "username": "81bbffed-f46c-43e5-997e-777e8ab1298f"
}
```

#### Updating

We will use the response as input for configuration. First we need to update our DNS providers CNAME settings
with the **fulldomain** value of the response. `_acme-challenge.yourdomain.tld` is the key required by LetsEncrypt.
In common bind notation we'd define

```bash
_acme-challenge.jeansdev.org   IN CNAME	84bba6b0-b446-42ff-8d22-11b27f4ff717.auth.acme-dns.io.
```

> NOTE: As a CNAME value you have to copy the "fulldomain" property value **terminated by a dot .** !

Usually you have to use your dns providers console or webinterface for that.
Homekube's DNS host is [Artfiles.de](https://artfiles.de) and screenshots of the dns webinterface modifications
[#1](images/artfiles_dns_webui.png) [#2 (with Github pages and pi subdomain)](images/artfiles_dns_with_github_and_pi.png) is provided as a reference.

> Note again the **trailing dot .** !

Next we'll check (a google nameserver) if configuration was successful

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 _acme-challenge.jeansdev.org
```

The response will contain a line like

```
;; ANSWER SECTION:
_acme-challenge.jeansdev.org. 599 IN	CNAME	84bba6b0-b446-42ff-8d22-11b27f4ff717.auth.acme-dns.io.
```

[![](images/ico/color/youtube_16.png) ![](images/ico/terminal_16.png) 4:15 Acme-Dns manual update demo](https://asciinema.org/a/94903)

Next we follow the
[![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) ACME-DNS configuration instructions](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/acme/dns01/acme-dns/)
and save the registration response into a **.json** file **`acme-dns-homekube-org.json`** on the server in your current directory
with the **domain name as a key** and the **response as its value**.  
Replace `jeansdev.org` with a domain name of your choice.
**Example** **`acme-dns-homekube-org.json`** looks like:

```json
{
  "jeansdev.org": {
    "allowfrom": [],
    "fulldomain": "84bba6b0-b446-42ff-8d22-11b27f4ff717.auth.acme-dns.io",
    "password": "mPSNztp-s_m2atJtT8wapPQ7Z4AIIyE4i5H7fQas",
    "subdomain": "84bba6b0-b446-42ff-8d22-11b27f4ff717",
    "username": "81bbffed-f46c-43e5-997e-777e8ab1298f"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Cert-Manager

Now that we have the helpers in place we need a last step to complete the installation

- Create a secret from the previously saved registration response
- Create a Certficate template that will be signed
- by an Issuer to be defined

Lets create our own namespace first to prevent cluttering the default namespace and edit a local copy
of `homekube-staging.yaml` and `homekube-prod.yaml` to replace the occurrences of `jeansdev.org` and `homekube`
with the name of your top-level domain.

```bash
export HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN=jeansdev.org
export HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN_DASHED=${HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN//./-}  # all dots in domain name are replaced by dashes to comply with rfc requirements
#export HOMEKUBE_CERT_URL=https://acmedns.a-hahn.org
export HOMEKUBE_CERT_URL=https://auth.acme-dns.io

kubectl create ns cert-manager-${HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN_DASHED}
kubectl create secret generic acme-dns-secret -n cert-manager-${HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN_DASHED} --from-file=acme-dns-secret-key=acme-dns-${HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN_DASHED}.json
envsubst < staging-template.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

Lets verify our installation

```bash
kubectl describe secret tls-staging -n cert-manager-homekube-org
```

should evaluate to

```
Name:         tls-staging
...
Type:  kubernetes.io/tls

Data
====
ca.crt:   0 bytes
tls.crt:  3562 bytes
tls.key:  1679 bytes
```

The important part here is that both **tls.crt** and **tls.key** must be present and not empty.  
**This may take a while until the tls.crt is present and its size is > 0 !**.  
In case of errors check cert-manager logs to see the progress

```bash
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace cert-manager -l "app=cert-manager,app.kubernetes.io/component=controller" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl logs $POD_NAME -f -n cert-manager
```

and follow the [![](images/ico/color/kubernetes_16.png) troubleshooting steps](https://cert-manager.io/docs/faq/acme/).
Note that you need to append all commands with ` -n cert-manager-acme-secrets` as thats the namespace that we use
for the Certificate. The same namespace will be used for all child resources as secrets, certificaterequests, orders, ... .

If everything goes well we can obtain the 'real' certificate form LetsEncrypt production endpoint. LetsEncrypt has quite
[![](images/ico/book_16.png) restricitve rate-limits](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/) about the usage
of its production endpoint so you better double-check with the staging-endpoint.

The production manifests are the same as staging except that:

- the acme server endpoint `https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`  
  is replaced by `https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`
- all other occurrences of `staging` are replaced by `prod`

```bash
envsubst < prod-template.yaml | kubectl apply -f -
```

**Be patient** It may take a couple of minutes until the `tls-prod` secret becomes available in the namespace.
The option `--watch` monitors the namespace.

```bash
root@homekube:~/homekube/src/cert-manager# kubectl get secrets -n cert-manager-homekube-org --watch
NAME                      TYPE                DATA   AGE
acme-dns-secret           Opaque              1      3m40s
cert-issuer-account-key   Opaque              1      3m39s
tls-staging               kubernetes.io/tls   2      2m33s
tls-prod                  kubernetes.io/tls   2      9s
```

Check the resulting secret

```bash
kubectl describe secret tls-prod -n cert-manager-homekube-org
```

contains non-empty **tls.crt** and **tls.key** you are done

## Updating Ingress

Finally we will update our Ingress configuration to take advantage of our certificates.
The simplest solution is to update Ingress controllers deployment to use our
fresh certificate by default:

The `kubectl patch` command adds the certificate to the controller:

```bash
kubectl patch deployment "nginx-helm-ingress-nginx-controller" \
    -n "ingress-nginx" \
    --type "json" \
    --patch '[
      {"op":"add","path":"/spec/template/spec/containers/0/args/-",
      "value":"--default-ssl-certificate=cert-manager-'${HOMEKUBE_DOMAIN_DASHED}'/tls-prod"}]'
```

Check patch validity

```bash
EDITOR=nano kubectl edit deployment.apps/nginx-helm-ingress-nginx-controller -n ingress-nginx
```

That command opens an editor with lots of deployment configuration and we scroll down and look for
the commands that configure the arguments of the controller:

```text
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - /nginx-ingress-controller
        - --publish-service=ingress-nginx/nginx-helm-ingress-nginx-controller
        - --election-id=ingress-controller-leader
        - --ingress-class=nginx
        - --configmap=ingress-nginx/nginx-helm-ingress-nginx-controller
        - --validating-webhook=:8443
        - --validating-webhook-certificate=/usr/local/certificates/cert
        - --validating-webhook-key=/usr/local/certificates/key
        - --default-ssl-certificate=cert-manager-homekube-org/tls-prod
...
```

If patch did work as expected there should be an additional container argument with correct indentation:
`- --default-ssl-certificate=cert-manager-acme-secrets/homekube-tls-prod`.  
The code snippet above already shows the final result. If this line does not exist so just add it as above.

Now saving the editor will immediately activate the updated configuration.
Open a browser on any of the supported subdomains, e.g. `https://dashboard.jeansdev.org`.
There security warning has gone as we have provided a valid certificate !

## Troubleshoot failed renewals

Once in a while cert-manager fails to update. Excerpt from the logs:

```text
I0209 06:06:15.819563       1 controller.go:141] cert-manager/controller/certificaterequests-issuer-acme "msg"="syncing item" "key"="cert-manager-acme-secrets/homekube-certificate-prod-2758539001"

```

It seems that auto cleanup of failed requests does not work properly in all cases.
This issue comment [![](images/ico/github_16.png) helped to solve the problem](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/issues/2683#issuecomment-597300829)

```bash
# List all custom resource definition
kubctl get crd
# We are interested in orders and certificaterequests
kubectl get orders -A
kubectl get certificaterequests -A

# Delete suspicious entries e.g.
kubectl delete certificaterequest homekube-certificate-prod-xxxx -n cert-manager-acme-secret
kubectl delete order homekube-certificate-prod-xxxxxx-yyyyyyy -n cert-manager-acme-secrets
```
